# My solutions for Advent of Code 2021 in R

As the title says. All the solutions were made with R scripts using tidy
paradigm.

You can click [here](https://adventofcode.com/2021) to read the
exercises of each day and try to solve yourself.

## What is the Advent of Code? (taken from the official website)

Advent of Code is an Advent calendar of small programming puzzles for a
variety of skill sets and skill levels that can be solved in any
programming language you like. People use them as a speed contest,
interview prep, company training, university coursework, practice
problems, or to challenge each other.

You donâ€™t need a computer science background to participate - just a
little programming knowledge and some problem solving skills will get
you pretty far. Nor do you need a fancy computer; every problem has a
solution that completes in at most 15 seconds on ten-year-old hardware.

## Why solve in R?

I decided to solve the exercises in the R programming language because
it is the language that I use more recurrently in my day-to-day life and
feel more comfortable. This enables me to focus primarily on the logic
and algorithm of the problem and not so much with the syntax of a
particular language.

But it is a great exercise to practice solving the problems of the event
in other languages because it gives you a larger experience with other
tools.

## Have a great day!
